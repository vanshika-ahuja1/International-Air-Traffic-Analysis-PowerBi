# ✈️ International Air Traffic Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes international air traffic to and from India.  
It provides a comprehensive view of **passenger and freight movement across airlines, countries, and city routes** to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The aviation industry requires a clear understanding of:

- Passenger and freight movement trends  
- Airline performance and operational efficiency  
- High-traffic countries and city routes  
- Route imbalances and traffic volatility  

The objective of this project is to transform raw aviation data into **actionable insights through an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard**.
